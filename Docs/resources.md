# Resources

Static Resources: defined at compile time
Core Resources: resources to be loaded with the game for essential functions (fonts, engine logo, etc)
Scene resources: A scene defines a whole bunch of resources to load. You can define multiple scenes with a whole list of resources that the Manager will try to load/unload at relevant times. How would we do deferred loading? One resource with multiple LODs?
